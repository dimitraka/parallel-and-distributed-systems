	A) There are two Makefiles in the project:

	

		1) vptree/Makefile

		This Makefile is being used from the tester.



		2) vptree/src/Makefile

		This Makefile can be used to compile the .c files from the folder src. 



	
	B) To achieve a better time with pthreads than the sequential version you have 
	   to change the variable "maxThreads" from the file vptree_pthreads.c according 
	   to your processor's characteristics.

	   By default maxThreads = 16, because my PC has the following characteristics: 
	   Intel® Core™ i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz × 8 

	   So, you have to check if maxThreads should be 2,4,8,16 etc. The value that 
	   gives you the best time performance is the right one.
